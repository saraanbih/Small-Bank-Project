# **Small Bank System Project**  

Welcome to the **Small Bank System Project**! ðŸŽ‰  

This project simulates a basic bank system with functional programming principles. Although it shares similarities with a larger **Bank Project**, this version is much simpler and uses **functional programming**, unlike the Bank Project, which utilizes **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

## **Login System**  

Before accessing the system's main menu, you need to log in using your **username** and **password**.  
- **Validation**: You can only proceed if both the username and password are correct.  
- If incorrect, the system will prompt you to re-enter your credentials.

# **Small Bank System Project**  

Welcome to the **Small Bank System Project**! ðŸŽ‰  

This project simulates a basic bank system with functional programming principles. Although it shares similarities with a larger **Bank Project**, this version is much simpler and uses **functional programming**, unlike the Bank Project, which utilizes **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

## **Login System**  

Before accessing the system's main menu, you need to log in using your **username** and **password**.  
- **Validation**:  
  - The application checks if the entered username and password exist in the system.  
  - If the credentials are valid, the main menu will be displayed.  
  - If not, access is denied, and the user will be prompted to re-enter valid credentials.  

- **Permission-Based Access**:  
  - Users cannot access certain menus or perform specific actions unless they have the required permissions.  
  - Each userâ€™s access is restricted based on their assigned roles.
